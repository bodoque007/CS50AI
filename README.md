# What is this?
This is simply a short compilation of some of the projects from Harvard's CS50 AI course I enjoyed the most doing. Each project has a README file that briefly explains the project's purpose, technicalities and usage.
To anyone reading this, I strongly recommend taking this course, even if you don't (yet) consider AI as a career path.
