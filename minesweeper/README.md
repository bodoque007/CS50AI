## Minesweeper Automatic Player

This project is the second one in the course. The **runner.py** file runs the graphical interface which is implemented using the built-in library *pygame*.
The **minesweeper.py** file implements the logic of the AI. The AI simply plays by keeping track of the knowledge it has from the board and playing safe moves everytime it can, updating the knowledge for further moves.
