# What is this?
This is simply a short compilation of some of the projects from Harvard's CS50 AI course I enjoyed the most. Each project has a README file that briefly explains the project's purpose, technicalities and usage.
To anyone reading this, I strongly recommend taking this course, even if you don't (yet) consider AI as a career path.
## Requirements
The only common requirement to have installed on your OS to run the projects' files is (at least) [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), except from the **traffic** project, which has a *requirements.txt* file, indicating its extra requirements.
