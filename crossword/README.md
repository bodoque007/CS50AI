# Crossword player using Backtracking
This is the fourth proyect of the course. Given some crossword, the program solves it automatically making use of a backtracking algorithm technique and the [AC3 algoritm.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC-3_algorithm)

## Usage
To run the crossword player, write on a terminal inside the project's folder the following: `python generate.py {structure} {words} {output_file_name}.png`,
replacing {structure} for the name of the txt file that indicates the structure of the puzzle, {words} with the txt file containing the words available for the algorithm and {output_file_name} for the name of the .png file you want the resulting solved crossword to be outputted.
## Usage example
`python generate.py data/structure1.txt data/words1.txt output.png`
There will be an stylized output on the terminal of the resulting crossword, apart from the .png file created with the solved crossword.
